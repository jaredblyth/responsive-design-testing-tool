This tool has been built to help with testing your responsive websites while you design and build them.

You can view a live demo of this code at http://jaredblyth.com/demos/responsive-design-testing-tool

You can enter your website's URL into the address bar at the top of this page (not your browser's address bar) to test a specific page.

Unfortunately, with the way browser security works, you are unable to navigate your site through the frames that your website appears in.

Note: The content width may not be pixel perfect - 15px has been added to the iframes to cater for the scrollbars.

There is also an iPad only version of this responsive design testing tool - http://jaredblyth.com/demos/responsive-design-testing-tool/ipad-only.html
